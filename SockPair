Pair of Socks
There are A red socks, B green socks and C Yellow socks in a dark room. Ashwin wants to find N
pairs of matching colored socks from the dark room.
Given all A, B and C are even and N ≤ (A+B+C)/2, write a program that outputs how many socks
Ashwin would have to draw from the dark room in the worst case, to have exactly N pairs.
1. Input Format
First line contains three space separated integers: A, B and C.
Second line contains the number of pairs Ashwin wants: N.
2. Output Format
Single line containing a single integer which is the count of socks needed to draw in the worst case
3. Constraints
0 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 106
0 ≤ N ≤ (A + B + C)/2
4. Example
Input 1:
2 4 4
1
Output 1:
4
Input 2:
2 4 4
4
Output 2:
9
Input 3:
2 4 4
5
Output 3:
10
